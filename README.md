# 🧠 AI Score Prediction Game 🎯

A Python-based interactive game that uses machine learning to predict scores or outcomes based on user input and historical data. Designed to demonstrate the power of AI in real-time decision-making and predictive analytics.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎲 Interactive score prediction game
- 🤖 Machine Learning model trained on historical data
- 📊 Real-time prediction of scores or outcomes
- 🧪 Model evaluation and accuracy metrics
- 🖥️ Simple GUI or CLI for user interaction (Tkinter or terminal)
- 📁 Modular and well-documented codebase

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (choose based on your model)  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Tkinter or customtkinter (for GUI, optional)
